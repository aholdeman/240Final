240GeneFinal is a program to implement biologic DNA fragmentation through command-line arguments. 
Developed in Columbia, SC for the CSCE 240 Final Project at the University of South Carolina. 
By Phoebe Ngo, Abby Holdeman, and Lauren Nix.

Using the command-line, the user will be instructed in how to enter the arguments required for the program. 
Further information and context can be found in our Requirements Document and Final Report. 
Upon completion of the program, the resulting sequence is sent to an output file, accessible to the user. 
Assumption is made that the user has access to and knowledge of the command-line. :)

To run: "make", which will compile the .cpp files into an executable "240GeneFinal", then run the executable as follows:
                       ./240GeneFinal <name of input file> <name of output file> <minimum overlap>
